# To-do list (edit when tasks are completed)
- Make the player have a radial white glow when they have an Immortal Heart. Maybe when they have half an Immortal Heart it can fade in and out continuously to symbolize damage
- Devil Deal visual change (Instead of showing up as Soul/Black hearts, the cost shows up as Immortal Hearts)
